# FlashCards App
## Running the code
This code is not deployed. To run the app, you need to clone the repository. For privacy reasons, please do not open any .env file. The following steps to run the project locally assumes that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed. 
### Starting Backend Server
First, open a terminal at the root of this directory. Then, move to the server folder:

`cd flashcard-app`

Install the necessary dependencies with

`npm install`

Then start the server locally with 

`npm run dev`

This will start the server at http://localhost:9000/. Server is fully started when you see the `Connected to MongoDB` message. You can open `server/index.js` to change the corresponding port if you would like. 
### Starting Frontend Webpage
Open a different terminal at the root of this directory. Then, move to the client folder:

`cd flashcard-client`

Install the necessary dependencies with 

`npm install`
 
Then start the webpage locally with 

`npm run start`

If everything goes well, You should have the webpage starting at http://localhost:3000/ ðŸŽ‰. Feel free to change the port, it just have to be different from the server port.
